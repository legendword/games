# Legendword Games

Legendword Games aims to become an online minigame platform hosting both singleplayer and multiplayer games for anyone to play with ease.

Currently, we have the following games supported on the platform:

- Landlord (3-player card game)
- Wordle+ (Wordle with more word length choices)

More games are being added... You can let us know what games you would like on the platform by opening an issue in [Issues](https://github.com/legendword/games/issues).
